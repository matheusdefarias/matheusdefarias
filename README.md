<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Matheus de Farias Cavalcanti Santos</h1>
<h3 align="center">Software Engineer | Front-end | HTML | CSS | Javascript | React.Js |</h3>

<h2>:pouting_man: About me:</h2>
<p align="justify">I have a degree in Computer Engineering from the <a href="https://www.ufpe.br/" target="_blank">Federal University of Pernambuco</a>/<a href="https://portal.cin.ufpe.br/" target="_blank">Informatics Center</a> - UFPE/CIn. During the undergraduate program, I specialized in the areas of Digital Image Processing, Computer Vision and Deep Learning using libraries such as OpenCV and PyTorch. I have 5 years of professional experience in the areas of Digital Image Processing, Computer Vision, Deep Learning and in Back-end Web Development using Python and Django REST Framework.</p>

<p>I've always really liked visual/graphic elements and after working on Web Development projects, I became very interested in the area, mainly in interface development. So, currently I have been interested and focused on <strong><i>Front-end Web Development</i></strong> using the following technologies: <strong><i>HTML, CSS, Javascript and ReactJs.</i></strong></p>
